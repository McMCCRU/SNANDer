  Usage:
 -h             display this message
 -d             disable internal ECC(use read and write page size + OOB size - On-die ECC)
 -o <bytes>     manual set OOB size with disable internal ECC(default 0)
 -I             ECC ignore errors(for read test only)
 -k             Skip BAD pages, try read or write in to next page
 -L             print list support chips
 -i             read the chip ID info
 -E             select I2C EEPROM {24c01|24c02|24c04|24c08|24c16|24c32|24c64|24c128|24c256|24c512|24c1024}
                select Microwire EEPROM {93c06|93c16|93c46|93c56|93c66|93c76|93c86|93c96} (need SPI-to-MW adapter)
                select SPI EEPROM 25xxx {25010|25020|25040|25080|25160|25320|25640|25128|25256|25512|251024}
 -8             set organization 8-bit for Microwire EEPROM(default 16-bit) and set jumper on SPI-to-MW adapter
 -f <addr len>  set manual address size in bits for Microwire EEPROM(default auto)
 -s <bytes>     set page size from datasheet for fast write SPI EEPROM(default not usage)
 -e             erase chip(full or use with -a [-l])
 -l <bytes>     manually set length
 -a <address>   manually set address
 -w <filename>  write chip with data from filename
 -r <filename>  read chip and save data to filename
 -v             verify after write on chip
